# Eco-Sentinel: Industrial AI Dashboard

**A futuristic, immersive web interface for real-time industrial monitoring and AI reasoning.**

## 🌍 Vision
Eco-Sentinel represents the next generation of industrial control rooms. Departing from static, 2D dashboards, it embraces an "Anti-Gravity" aesthetic where data and physical assets float in a weightless digital twin environment. It visualizes the pulse of a factory: real-time data streams, anomaly detection, and instant AI reasoning.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. The "Anti-Gravity" 3D Core
- **Interactive Digital Twin**: A low-poly, wireframe industrial environment (pipes, turbines) rendered in real-time.
- **Physics-Based Interaction**: Elements drift weightlessly and react to cursor movement (magnetic repulsion/attraction), symbolizing live data ingestion.

### 2. Live Intelligence
- **Streaming Ticker**: An infinite scroll of raw sensor data (Temperature, Pressure, Vibration) visualizing high-velocity inputs.
- **RAG Reasoning Engine**: A visual demo of Retrieval-Augmented Generation, where the system "scans" documents to provide context-aware answers to operator queries.

### 3. Immersive UX/UI
- **Glassmorphism HUD**: Translucent, frosted-glass panels that float over the 3D background.
- **Neon Cyber Aesthetics**: High-contrast palette (Deep Void Black, Cyber Green, Alert Red) for immediate readability.
- **Levitating Interface**: UI cards that lift and tilt in 3D space upon interaction.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React (Vite)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **3D Engine**: React Three Fiber (Three.js)
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Scrolling**: Lenis (Smooth Scroll)

## 📦 How It Works
The dashboard simulates a connection to "Pathway," a high-throughput data processing engine.
1.  **Ingest**: Sensors stream data into the 3D environment.
2.  **Process**: The system applies real-time analytics (visualized by the HUD updates).
3.  **Reason**: The AI agent creates dynamic indexes from documentation to assist operators (RAG Demo).
